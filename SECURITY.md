## Handling of reports

When a vulnerability is reported:

- An acknowledgement will be sent as soon as reasonably possible, usually within a few business days.[web:103]

- After a fix is available, details of the issue may be summarized in commit messages or release notes, without exposing sensitive information or exploit details.[web:106]
